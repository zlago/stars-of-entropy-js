# stars of entropy

a silly browser game i am trying to make, that makes me hate the stereotypical web page even more

### running

locally:
- local host the repo and go to `http[s]://localhost:PORT/` (same device) or `http[s]://192.168.YOUR.IP:PORT/` (different device, LAN)

embedded into a page:
```html
<iframe src="http[s]://link/to/index.html"
title="stars of entropy, a javascript game">
	your browser does not support &lt;iframe&gt;
</iframe>
```

### dependencies:

- a web browser (eg. firefox)
- (optional) local hosting (eg. `python -m http.server PORT`)

### notes

if something here is unclear, then maybe youre not ready to run this yourself, sorry!

you may embed this into your website, as long as the origin of this is not misrepresented
